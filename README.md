## End to End Macchine Learning Project

This project is used to find the best ML Algorithms for a raw dataset given as input. Also Continuous-Integration and Continuous-Delivery Pipeline has also been implemented for easy updation, review and analysis of the project. 

Below are the ML Algorithms uswd in this project:
"Random Forest", "Decision Tree", "Gradient Boosting", "Linear Regression", "K-Neighbours Classifier", "XGBRegressor", "CatBoosting Regressor" and "AdaBoost Regressor".
